### Development

Make your relevant changes locally in the design-kit directory. You can run these changes
locally by using the DSK at https://github.com/dpa-gmbh/dsk. 

### Deployment

For Deployment verify your changes locally, *only then* merge them into the Master Branch and push. This
will trigger an automated deployment of a new version of the design-kit to
https://design-kit.dpa-connect.de.
